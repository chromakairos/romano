                <h2>The Open Air Fling</h2>
                <p>Having sexual intercourse outdoors in an isolated area is definitely the least recommended method due to the thermal stress your back would have to endure.</p>
                <p>Cold and damp represent a sure path to worsening symptoms.</p>
                <p>The only exception is the possibility of finding privacy in a <span class="f1">cabbage field</span>.</p>
                <p>In that case, the well-known <span class="f3">anti-inflammatory</span> properties of the plant could play a pleasant and unexpected soothing role in alleviating suffering.</p>

                <h2>The Car</h2>
                <p>It is imperative to choose a car with rigid shock absorbers. No, therefore, to cars with elastic suspensions that would stress the aching structure with jolts that are not always harmonious and coordinated.</p>
                <p>Off-road vehicles are highly recommended, or, for those who cannot afford the prohibitive cost of luxury vehicles, a more accessible station wagon. For owners of economy cars, at least, the <span class="f2">use of the back seats</span> is recommended, in order to spare yourself the abrasions produced by the infamous plastic steering wheels and strictly raised handbrake levers.</p>
                <p>These rigid and blunt appendages, coupled with relentless lower back pain, could lead to concrete thoughts in the mind of the sufferer of a decisive return to a less engaging but more comfortable regular onanism.</p>

                <h2>The Bed</h2>
                <p>Just as it represents the preferred means for <span class="f3">copulation</span> under normal circumstances, the bed is certainly one of the least suitable supports in cases of acute low back pain, considering the many studies that have stigmatized bed rest as one of the risk factors for chronic symptoms. If there is no other option, an <span class="f1">orthopedic mattress</span> is still essential.</p>
                <p>A normal mattress, in fact, in addition to the still little-studied <span class="f2">"rebound effect,"</span> mentioned in the previous paragraph, forces the back to maintain inadequate and painful postures. This, of course, is if the coupling positions have been chosen without a sufficient cultural background in the anatomy and physiology of the spine and without a reasonable range of etiological hypotheses for the disorder.</p>

                <p><em>Waterbeds are another story:</em><br/><br/>While rarely used, they produce a beneficial massage. If the male of the couple suffers from low back pain, the best technique is to adopt a less active role, remaining supine and imperceptibly guiding the partner's movements to synchronize the rhythm of the <span class="f2">thrusts</span> with the <span class="f3">ebb and flow</span> of the wave produced by the up-down movement. <a href="#figure5" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-5.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 5</a></p>

                <h2>The Beach</h2>
                <p>If you can take advantage of a secluded corner of the beach, it is highly recommended to seize the opportunity and thus benefit from the recognized properties of <span class="f1">psammotherapy</span>.</p>
                <p>It goes without saying that copulation must take place before sunset. Cases have been reported in the literature of imprudent low back pain sufferers who, having retired to a sandy beach at night, were struck down by the lethal "wet sand" effect and were indeed only discovered the next morning thanks to the humble act of the lifeguard raking the beach.</p>
                <p>To fully exploit the miraculous virtues of the sand, with the aid of beneficial post-orgasmic relaxation, you can quickly cover yourself with warm sand. Be careful! You must not forget to keep your legs tightly together, to protect the more delicate <span class="f2">appendages</span> (for him) or firmly close the vaginal opening (for her) so as not to incur devastating burns that would jeopardize the continuation of the therapeutic treatment. <a href="#figure6" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-6.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 6</a></p>

                <h2>The Bathtub</h2>
                <p>It is certainly the most <span class="f3">suitable solution</span> if one considers the peculiar characteristics of the liquid environment which exerts significant beneficial effects on the symptomatology.</p>
                <p>The reduction of the force of gravity in itself represents a desirable condition for loosening the tension that grips the loins. To this, one must naturally add the analgesic and muscle-relaxing effect of warm water (32°-34°), <a href="#figure7" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-7.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 7</a> not separate from the delicate hydromassage that the water exerts due to the turbulence created by the movement of bodies. In this regard, it is necessary to go into a little more detail.</p>
                <figure class="full">
                    <img src="/back-pain/assets/fig-7.jpg" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-7.jpg')" />

                </figure>
                <p>In the position where the male subject is lying supine, the alternating pressure action exerted by the partner's movements is transmitted to the companion's loins, which thus compresses and decompresses the water cushion interposed between the bottom of the tub and the lumbar area. The combined and alternating action of compression and decomposition will be of rare effectiveness in terms of reducing edema and, therefore, inflammation. <a href="#figure8" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-8.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 8</a></p>
                <figure class="full">
                    <img src="/back-pain/assets/fig-8.jpg" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-8.jpg')" />
                    <figcaption class="floatright"> Fig. 8</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>In the same position, if the female subject is suffering, it will be up to the partner to adequately press with their finger <span class="f1">phalanges</span> to exert a beneficial stretching massage on the contracted muscle structures. The sliding of the fingers will be automatic and reflexively generated by the alternating motion on the vertical axis.</p>
                <p style="--animation-order:5;">In the position where, instead, the female subject lies supine under the partner, in the case of her own lumbar pain, the soothing massage action due to water compression is the same as described a few lines above. For the male low back pain sufferer, however, in this same position, the massage will be exerted by the splashing of the water on the painful area. <a href="#figure9" onclick="openModal('/assets/fig-9.jpg')" class="citation"> Fig. 9</a></p>
                <p>In this case, it will be a less aggressive action, comparable to the effleurage maneuver of manual massage therapy. Due to its mild stimulation, this modality is certainly advisable in the most acute phases.</p>
                <p>The ultimate could be achieved by diluting medicinal substances in the water. It is strongly advised not to repeat an <span class="f2">experiment</span> performed some years ago by a staunch advocate of ionophoresis.</p>
                <p>The intrepid pioneer wanted to massively exploit the principle of penetration of medicinal ions, carried by electric current. He therefore connected an open circuit to the bathtub and confidently immersed himself. Of him are remembered a notepad with incomplete observations of the experiment and the bitter (and somewhat vulgar) invectives his wife hurled at him on the day of the funeral when she realized that her audacious husband had forgotten to renew his life insurance. <a href="#figure10" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-10.jpg')" class="citation"> Fig. 10</a></p>

                <h2>The Elevator</h2>
                <p>Although considered one of the most exciting places for unrestrained erotic performances, it is advisable to postpone the experience until better times. The environment is too cramped and forces one to assume <span class="f3">awkward postures</span>.</p>
                <p>The jolt that accompanies the stop, moreover, is truly lethal in some cases and could mercilessly pin you down.</p>
                <p>Watch out for the opening door. The sight of a man with his pants around his ankles or a woman with her skirt raised but clutching at the button placket with a grimace of pain distorting her face, would severely test even the strongest heart of the unfortunate person waiting for the cabin.</p>
                <p>Don't tempt fate. You risk indictment for <span class="f1">manslaughter</span>!</p>

                <h2>The Kitchen Table</h2>
                <p>This piece of furniture has always represented one of the unspoken erotic fantasies that has taken up permanent residence in the minds of all who have seen the film made famous by the impatient postman. To a superficial eye, the kitchen table may convey a false impression of discomfort and a latent sensation of poor hygiene. The support, however, offers an <span class="f2">unexpected</span> series of advantages that can be obtained with very simple precautions.</p>

                <p>Let's start with the rigidity of the surface. Although in the minds of most men and women, the comfort of the sleeping surface represents an added value to the quality of the coupling performance, the rigidity of a surface like that of a table can create a pleasant attenuation of the symptom. This result is not guaranteed in all cases because there are situations in which the reduction of the <span class="f1">lumbar curve</span>, favored by the rigid surface, improves symptoms and other situations where the rigid surface can generate a painfully negative effect. So, after a quick first try, you can quickly realize if it is possible to continue and in other cases where the exacerbation of the pain leads you to change your mind and stop simulating the famous scene from the movie "The Postman Always Rings Twice" by moving on to others from "Last Tango in Paris." It goes without saying that this reasoning only applies if the female partner is suffering from low back pain. In the case of low back pain in the male subject, the only thing to worry about is checking if the height of the surface is compatible with a not too uncomfortable penetration.</p>

                <p>The real modification that can be attempted is related to the inclination of the surface. Symmetrically lifting two table legs allows you to create a simplistic "inversion bench". This is a tool that uses gravity and body weight to achieve <span class="f3">traction</span> of the lumbar compartment. Even in this case, a practical test is necessary to verify that this traction does not accentuate the pain. In this regard, a <span class="f1">heartfelt</span> piece of advice is to only start after you have put a pot of salted water to boil. If the improvised inversion bench does not work, the advice is to quickly put the table back in place and throw in the pasta to quickly organize a less erotic but always tasty spaghetti carbonara, miraculous for tempering the disappointment.</p>

            <div class="block block-single-col">
                <h2>The Washing Machine</h2>
                <p>It is very likely that the first creators of a machine capable of alleviating the toil of doing laundry had absolutely no ulterior use of their instrument in mind.</p>

                <p>For about a century, washing machines have assumed the legitimate role of primary home appliance capable of reducing household chores. Among the functions that have progressively been added was the fundamental <span class="f1">centrifuge</span>, which allows clothes to be wrung out thanks to the natural force, which has the same name, generated by the sudden increase in the rotation speed of the drum.</p>

                <p>The developers of these progressive technological improvements had to devise systems of shock absorbers that would prevent the high speed of the drum from being dangerously transmitted to the washing machine casing. The <span class="f2">vibrations</span> were increasingly well-controlled but impossible to eliminate.</p>

                <p>This rapid mechanical movement very quickly stimulated the imagination of some unknown admirer of erotic alternatives who thought of using the machine's vibration to accentuate the <span class="f3">stimulation</span> of the pelvic erogenous zones during intercourse.</p>

                <p>This original idea has always been greatly appreciated, so much so that it has generated centrifuge fan clubs that still animatedly discuss the most effective number of revolutions per minute.</p>

                <p>As often happens, the development of a new tool or technique allows for its evolution when used by people other than its <span class="f1">inventors</span>.</p>

                <p>This is what happened to the washing machine when it was used alternatively by a woman with low back pain who, at the end of the spin cycle and the vibrating carnal relationship with her husband, put her feet back on the ground.</p>

                <p>The woman happily experienced the simultaneous disappearance of the back pain that had been tormenting her for several weeks. The prolonged vibration for several minutes had <span class="f2">miraculously</span> eliminated the symptom that no previous treatment technique had managed to scratch.</p>

                <p>Overwhelmed with enthusiasm, the first accidental guinea pig of this unexpected experiment quickly composed herself and, to her great surprise, was even able to take out the newly washed laundry without being forced to <span class="f3">bend</span> her knees.</p>
