                    <p style="--animation-order:2;">I have a very vivid memory of a very elegant lady, a well-known international lawyer, whom I had the pleasure and honor of treating for acute low back pain. One day, during one of her follow-up visits, she recounted an episode that perfectly illustrates the difficulties and anguish of those who suffer from lumbago.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:3;">"Doctor, my back pain is killing me!" she exclaimed breathlessly, with an expression that, for those who know the dramatic effects of this ailment, left no doubt about her state of suffering. "I can't even make love anymore!"</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:4;">This was not some ordinary individual who had come to my office, but a strong-willed, determined, and tenacious woman, accustomed to taking risks and dealing with the most diverse and difficult situations in life without ever yielding.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:5;">However, the experience of "lumbago," as her predicament is formally called, had quite literally brought her to her knees.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:6;">"I'm at the end of my rope," she continued, "I couldn't even stand the touch of my partner, and every time I tried, the pain was so acute that it literally made me scream."</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:7;">This statement, which initially left me somewhat puzzled and disoriented, was, on closer inspection, nothing new. It was actually the most common complaint I received from 90% of my patients regarding the topic of "intimate relations" during an acute low back pain crisis.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:8;">It is evident that the severe pain itself creates a psychological barrier that can inhibit any intimate desire.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:9;">However, this phenomenon also has a precise physiological explanation linked to the defensive mechanisms that the body puts in place during episodes of acute pain.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:10;">As some of you may know, the word "lumbago" literally means "pain in the lumbar [lower back] region." The acute crisis is a condition of pain so intense that it prevents any movement of the trunk and forces the patient into a "blocked" position, or more precisely, an "antalgic" position, insofar as the body is compensating in an attempt to escape the pain.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:11;">Usually, this position involves an inclination of the trunk to one side and a partial flexion forward, often accompanied by pain that can radiate along the entire lower limb (sciatica or femoralgia).</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:12;">The causes of this pain are numerous, but for simplicity, we can summarize them as inflammatory processes that lead to irritation of the nerve roots or joint capsules that pervade the entire lumbosacral region.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:13;">The primary purpose of the antalgic, anti-pain posture is to protect the anatomical structures affected by this inflammation from further damage.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:14;">And this is the primary cause underlying the sexual "impotence" (if we can call it that) that afflicts 90% of people suffering from lower back pain.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:15;">The anatomical structures involved in the inflammatory processes that lead to lumbar pain are the same ones that, during intercourse, are subjected to mechanical stress, sometimes considerable.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:16;">The body, which, as mentioned, activates automatic mechanisms to protect the inflamed area, is unable to distinguish between a "positive" mechanical stress, for example aimed at carnal embrace, from a "negative" mechanical stress, aimed perhaps at lifting a weight or performing some other daily activity.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:17;">For the body, mechanical stress is mechanical stress, and its response to protect the area will always be the same: a painful "block" that makes any type of movement impossible.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:18;">And so, in the most beautiful moment of intimate union with his or her partner, the back pain sufferer finds themselves blocked by sudden pain.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:19;">This happens to those who are suffering from an acute crisis, and it interrupts, as in the case of the elegant lawyer, any intimate relationship.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:20;">Unable to even console himself with sex, the low back pain sufferer falls into depression and triggers a perverse spiral of <span class="f2">PAIN-IMPOTENCE</span> that can lead him or her, depending on the duration of the symptoms, from absolute <span class="f3">"apatia coeundi"</span> to the radical choice of a contemplative life in a Cistercian monastery. This latter case applies, naturally, to males...</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:21;">The heartfelt plea for help from so many unhappy people could not, therefore, remain unheard.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:22;">In recent years, the ever-improving knowledge of the mechanisms at the origin of <span class="f1">back pain</span> puts us in a position to counteract, with considerable effectiveness, the malignant grip that tightens and paralyzes the loins.</p>

                    <p style="--animation-order:23;">In the following chapters, you will finally discover all the necessary precautions to take, the techniques to master, and the choices to make in order to win at least one battle in the eternal struggle against <span class="f3">back pain</span> and to ward off, with as few sacrifices as possible, the subtle attacks of what can rightly be considered the evil of the century.</p>
