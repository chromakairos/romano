                <p>If you're still reading this, it means you're still grappling with the pains of lumbago, but you're a true champion: a fighter who doesn't give up in the face of difficulties but rather faces them head-on, trying to find a valid solution even in the most desperate situations.</p>
                <p>This chapter is dedicated to you, tireless seeker of new methods to cope with life's setbacks. It will offer you an unexpected and, in some ways, amusing solution: <span class="f1">role-playing games</span>.</p>
                <p>These games are primarily aimed at those who suffer from acute lumbago and therefore cannot perform elaborate movements. They will allow you to maintain, at least to some extent, an intimate relationship with your partner without aggravating the painful situation.</p>
                <p>Here are some examples.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block block-single-col">
                <h2>The Doctor and the Patient</h2>
                <p>You, the low back pain sufferer, will be the patient. You will therefore be able to lie comfortably on your back, while your partner, the doctor, will lean over you to perform the "necessary" clinical investigations. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-23.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 23</a></p>

                <figure class="full">
                    <img src="/back-pain/assets/fig-23.jpg" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-23.jpg')" />
                    <figcaption class="floatleft">Fig. 23</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>This situation is particularly suitable for those who suffer from <span class="f1">acute lumbago</span> and therefore cannot perform complex movements. The doctor can be male or female, depending on the preference of the back pain sufferer.</p>
                <p>For greater realism of the situation, it is advisable to equip yourself with a white coat and, if possible, a stethoscope.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="block block-single-col">
                <h2>Little Red Riding Hood</h2>
                <p>Since the main scene is where the <span class="f3">wolf</span> disguised as grandma awaits <span class="f1">Little Red Riding Hood</span>, you should choose the more comfortable role without hesitation. You will thus have the opportunity to lie down.</p>
                <p>A <span class="f2">hot water bottle</span> expertly slipped under the covers is a sign of wise planning. Draw out the famous dialogue ("big ears to hear you better", etc...) a bit longer to allow the <span class="f2">hot water bottle</span> adequate time to act and prepare for action.</p>
                <p>But be careful!-- The moment the classic script would require you to leap like lightning onto your partner (<span class="f1">Little Red Riding Hood</span>) to gobble them up, let caution prevail.</p>
                <p>Ask them to lie on the bed, as you roll next to them with <span class="f2">dignity</span>. Probably, with this variation, the scene loses a bit of its drama, but it will give you a much greater <span class="f3">chance</span> of making it to the end of the story. <a href="#figure24" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-24.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 24</a></p>
