                    <h2>The Porter</h2>
                    <p>Enthusiasts of this pleasant, but strenuous, position will find it difficult to practice if they are in an acute phase. The weight and anterior overhang, in fact, will severely test the resistance of suffering structures such as the <span class="f1">lumbar muscles</span>. For the unyielding, however, some precautions can be recommended to derive at least some therapeutic benefits from it.</p>
                    <p>The trick to making the most of the position is to lean your lower back against a radiator.</p>
                    <p>By taking the precaution of interposing at least one layer of material that cushions the heat, you can benefit from the unparalleled <span class="f3">pain-relieving</span> and <span class="f2">muscle-relaxing</span> action of exogenous thermotherapy.</p>
                    <p>An important consideration: heat begins to take effect after at least <span class="f3">20 minutes</span> of application. Excluding the physique you need to have to support a person (even a thin one) for so long, if you suffer from <span class="f1">premature ejaculation</span>, do your calculations... <a href="#figure20" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-20.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 19</a></p>

                    <h2>The Throne</h2>
                    <p>This is one of the most accessible variations, thanks to the minimal effort required to maintain the position.</p>
                    <p>A <span class="f1">gem</span> not to be overlooked is the possibility of using a comfortable <span class="f1">lumbar pillow</span> that properly orientates the correct alignment of the <span class="f3">sagittal curves</span>. The hands of the one who is beneath (normally the man) will be placed on the lumbar region of the one who dominates to actively perform the same action.</p>
                    <p>Pay attention to the height of the chair. One that is too low could make it difficult to return to the <span class="f2">standing position</span> and prolong your stay on the seat indefinitely. <a href="#figure21" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-21.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 21</a></p>

                    <h2>The Wheelbarrow</h2>

                    <p>This is a difficult performance to achieve even in the <span class="f1">absence</span> of painâ€¦</p>

                    <p>It requires excellent physical condition and a strong sense of balance from both <span class="f3">partners</span>, in order to reach a <span class="f2">happy conclusion</span> without head trauma.</p>

                    <p>The type of advantage of this position depends on which of the two suffers from back pain.</p>

                    <p>In the case of low back pain in the male subject, the benefit is determined by the <span class="f1">analgesic compression</span> that the partner's closed legs exert on the painful area, especially if the symptom is localized in the <span class="f3">sacral area</span>.</p>

                    <p>If the pain, however, is the female subject's prerogative, the benefit is determined by the extension of the lumbar area, as already mentioned in the paragraph relating to techniques and the McKenzie method.</p>

                    <p>It is recommended to practice this variation when the symptoms have almost completely resolved to take advantage of the postural instability that characterizes it. This peculiar aspect will have the great advantage of allowing a fine <span class="f2">proprioceptive</span> strengthening exercise for the lumbar musculature. <a href="#figure22" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-22.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 22</a></p>
