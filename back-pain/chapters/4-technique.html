                <p>The choice of positions is undoubtedly the crucial aspect of the whole matter. As is known, the spatial orientation of the various bone segments and the incidence of <span class="f3">gravity</span> play a key role in the evolution of symptoms. It will, therefore, be convenient to carefully study the various possibilities for wisely choosing the most suitable <span class="f1">postural</span> modalities for the case.</p>

                <h2>Globalist Techniques of French Origin</h2>

                <p>These identify alterations in the tension and length of muscle chains as the cause of low back pain. It is possible, then, with a little imagination, to combine the satisfaction of <span class="f2">sexual urges</span> with the need to restore lost muscular balance.</p>
                <p>The following figure clearly shows how the subject without pain (in this case, the female) can help the aching partner achieve stretching of the posterior muscle chain, using a posture that refers to one of the classics advocated by <span class="f1">Françoise Mézières</span>. <a href="#figure15" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-15.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 15</a></p>
                <p>This highly effective technique is particularly recommended in crowded condominiums, as the <span class="f3">groans of pain</span> induced by forced stretching are effectively muffled by the anatomical silencer provided by the <span class="f2">partner's gluteal apparatus</span>.</p>

                <h2>McKenzie Technique</h2>
                <p>In enunciating his theory, the late New Zealand physiotherapist identified compression of sensitive nerve structures by the <span class="f3">intervertebral disc</span> as one of the causes of low back pain.</p>

                <p>The proposed treatment, in this case, consists of a series of rhythmic compressions of the displaced disc portion that is compressing the nerves. These compressions on the disc are performed to seek a better positioning between the two contiguous vertebrae.</p>

                <p>The astonishing correspondence between the <span class="f2">pelvic movement</span> that accompanies classic copulation and the exercises proposed by McKenzie immediately jumps out. <a href="#figure16" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-16.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 16</a></p>

                <p>It is evident, therefore, that it is possible not only to find a <span class="f1">painless</span> mode of intercourse but even to take the opportunity to perform a true specific treatment session.</p>

                <p>After defining whether the exercise should be performed in <span class="f3">flexion</span> (scheme 1) or <span class="f2">extension</span> (scheme 2), and for this, preliminaries are generally sufficient, it is possible to proceed to choosing the most convenient position.</p>

                <p>To perform extension exercises (the most common), in principle, it is advisable to orient towards positions that allow the pelvis to maintain a <span class="f1">good degree of freedom</span> to move in anteversion (figure above for female with low back pain and figure below for male with low back pain). <a href="#figure17" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-17.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 17</a></p>

                <p>Conversely, for flexion exercises, it will be more conveniently possible to use positions in which the pelvis can move <span class="f3">more easily</span> in the opposite direction (figure above for female with low back pain and figure below for male with low back pain). <a href="#figure18" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-18.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 18</a></p>

                <h2>Lumbar Stabilization</h2>
                <p>This technique aims to train the holding function of the deep muscles of the spine, whose primary task is to <span class="f1">maintain the alignment of the vertebrae</span>.</p>

                <p>This stabilization function is increased by finding the best vertebral alignment position and challenging it with controlled actions of minor motor stress. The progressive ability of the stabilizing muscles hinders the small and temporary displacement of the vertebrae that can generate pain.</p>

                <p>As can be inferred from the description of the previous techniques, the handicap of this treatment is the limited possibility of making large movements once the most suitable position has been found.</p>

                <p>To progressively increase the difficulty of maintaining correct vertebral alignment, practitioners of this technique are allowed <span class="f3">reckless maneuvers</span> that will train the stability of the lumbar spine while also stimulating an ever-greater level of <span class="f2">imagination</span>. <a href="#figure19" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-19.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 19</a></p>
