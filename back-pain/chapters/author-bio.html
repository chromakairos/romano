                <p style="--animation-order:2;">The author came into the world in <span class="f2">Naples</span> more than a few years ago. As soon as he was born, he cried incessantly for the first six weeks, causing his parents a whirlwind of emotions that can be synthetically described by the sequence: <span class="f3">tenderness… worry… dismay… bewilderment… hysterical crisis… homicidal instinct</span>.</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:3;">Every attempt to <span class="f2">calm him</span> was in vain. The poor little one, in fact, was not tormented by any of the trivial physiological needs that torment newborns.</p>

                <p class="f1" style="--animation-order:3; font-style:italic;">He had back pain...</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:3;">Those <span class="f3">acute</span> pleas for help did not translate into an urgent need for breast milk but, rather, for an effective painkiller.</p>
                <p style="--animation-order:4;">The <span class="f1">crisis</span> passes when his mother, in a stroke of genius, stops massaging his belly and moves to his back, finally making his lips curl into a faint smile, already veiled by the grim awareness of his bitter destiny.</p>
                <p style="--animation-order:5;">He grew up happily with <span class="f2">inseparable</span> friends, the radiologist's son and the orthopedist's son. The only worry he remembers is that of afternoon snacks where, instead of bread and Nutella, he was forced to crunch large pills of sad calcium supplements...</p>
                <p style="--animation-order:6;">After compulsory schooling, he followed what seemed like a path <span class="f3">traced</span> by destiny and diligently applied himself to the study of spinal pathologies. This little manual is the fruit of painful (in the true sense of the word) reflections and tormented (likewise) ponderings.</p>
                <p style="--animation-order:7;">To tell the truth, the author <span class="f1">asserts</span> that since he wrote it, he has no longer had painful crises.</p>
                <p style="--animation-order:8;">He becomes a little more vague when asked if this is due to the fact that he is truly <span class="f2">cured</span> or whether he has simply found his peace with the situation...</p>
