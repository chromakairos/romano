                    <p>The sudden yielding would subject the pelvis to an abrupt acceleration, followed by the sudden impact of the iliac spines against the <span class="f1">partner's pelvis</span>.</p>

                    <p>This lethal cocktail of kinematic modifications would result in the <span class="f3">abrupt propulsion</span> of the nucleus pulposus towards the posterior compartment of the disk and an instantaneous return of painful symptoms. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-1.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 1</a></p>

                    <h2>Cribriform Hymen</h2>
                    <p>The hymen presents an irregular series of fissures that will modify the normal perpendicular orientation of <span class="f2">penetration</span>, forcing the lumbopelvic complex into an unnatural and potentially harmful torsion. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-2.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 2</a></p>

                    <h2>Elastic Hymen</h2>
                    <p>One might encounter one of the elusive but fortunately rare elastic hymens.</p>
                    <p>In this case, the <span class="f1">"rebound effect"</span> would cause a very painful stretching of the inflamed structures.</p>
                    <p>Authoritative experts agree that <span class="f3">one case</span> of lumbago <span class="f2">out of every circa 2 million</span> can be resolved with a mechanical stress comparable to the recoil of the elastic hymen.</p>
                    <p>The percentage of positive resolutions, however, is so low that attempts are discouraged. <a href="#figure3" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-3.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 3</a></p>

                <p style="--animation-order:1;">Another imperative precaution is to be sure that the partner does not have a <span class="f3">partner</span> or, at the very least, not a jealous one.</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:2;">I'm talking about those individuals, for example, who have the bad habit of coming home or showing up even in the most isolated <span class="f2">motel</span> at the most crucial moment.</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:3;">In conditions of full physical wellbeing, a speedy retreat is almost always possible, or at the very least, the creation of a diversion giving adequate time to hide.</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:4;">Quite another story, however, when the back is gripped by unspeakable pains... in which case, the time to bend over and <span class="f1">crawl</span> miserably is around eight and a half minutes on average, an interval more than sufficient to allow the betrayed strongman (or strongwoman!) to overcome any weak attempts at misdirection by their unfaithful companion.</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:5;">Typically, they rush into the room and find you blocked at <span class="f3">about 45° of trunk inclination</span>, with one hand on your lower back and the other trying to pitifully cover your shame. To tell the truth, in the case of a male with lumbago, the apparatus is by this point so shriveled by the lethal combination of pain and anguish that one could try to convince her that one has definitively embarked on the path to peace of mind.</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:6;">Naturally, the choice of such a defensive line depends on each individual's persuasive abilities.</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:7;">Another typical escape route is the <span class="f2">classic windowsill</span>.</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:8;">Overlooking the considerable difficulties of getting onto it, this solution is nevertheless discouraged as drafts of wind, which have the regrettable negative characteristic of blowing outside windows, would represent a ruthless coup de grâce. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-4.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 4</a></p>

                <figure class="half floatright">
                    <img src="/back-pain/assets/fig-4.jpg" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-4.jpg')" />
                    <figcaption class="floatleft">Fig. 4</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p style="--animation-order:9;">In the interest of comprehensive, it is worth mentioning an episode reported in some texts of <span class="f3">vertebral column anatomopathology</span>.</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:10;">This is the case of an unfortunate individual who, to hide from a furious husband who unexpectedly burst into the house, clung to the windowsill for at least 5 minutes.</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:11;">The new acrobat had suffered from chronic lower back pain for almost 20 years. After this interminable period suspended in the void, the pain never reappeared.</p>

                <p style="--animation-order:12;">The experts who studied the case attributed a miraculous realignment of the facet joints of the lumbar vertebrae to the unexpected <span class="f1">prolonged traction</span>, originally lost two decades earlier due to trauma.</p>
