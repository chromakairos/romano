                <h2>The Open Air Fling</h2>
                <p>Having sexual intercourse outdoors in an isolated area is certainly the least recommended method due to the thermal stress the back would have to endure.</p>
                <p>Cold and damp represent a sure passport to worsening symptoms.</p>
                <p>The only exception is the possibility of being able to retreat to a <span class="f1">cabbage field</span>.</p>
                <p>In this case, the well-known <span class="f3">anti-inflammatory</span> properties of the plant could play a pleasant and unexpected role in alleviating suffering.</p>

            <div class="block block-single-col">
                <h2>The Car</h2>
                <p>It is imperative to choose a car with rigid shock absorbers. Cars with elastic suspensions are a no-go, as they would subject the already suffering occupant(s) to jolts that are not always particularly harmonious or coordinated.</p>
                <p>If you are surprised by sudden <span class="f1">lumbago</span> while travelling, it is better to equip yourself with a <span class="f3">hard mattress</span> to be placed on the back seat.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, the <span class="f2">hood</span> of the car can also be a valid support.</p>
                <p>However, it is necessary to check that the hood is not too flexible, and therefore, does not yield under the stress of the movement. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-5.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 5</a></p>

                <h2>The Boat</h2>
                <p>Choosing a boat with sufficient tonnage is crucial. Small boats, in fact, due to the pitching and rolling, would put the already suffering spine under constant <span class="f2">stress</span>. Also, avoid sailboats because the movements would be too sudden.</p>
                <p>The best choice would be a <span class="f3">catamaran</span> or a <span class="f1">motoryacht</span>.</p>
                <p>A curious episode is reported in a text of "marine medicine": during an ocean crossing, the captain of a motoryacht had been suffering from an acute lumbago crisis for several days.</p>
                <p>His wife, in a desperate attempt to cheer him up, decided to entertain him with a brief but intense intimate encounter.</p>
                <p>The gentle oscillations of the boat magically resolved the severe back pain that had been tormenting him for some time. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-6.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 6</a></p>

                <h2>The Train</h2>
                <p>The absolute choice for those who want to experience the thrill of a short but intense sexual encounter. The slight oscillations of the train represent the ideal condition for those suffering from <span class="f1">back pain</span>.</p>
                <p>The medical literature reports an unusual case of <span class="f2">herniated disc</span> that, with this mode of transport, was totally resolved.</p>
                <p>In this case, the <span class="f3">continuous micro-mobilizations</span> generated by the rhythmic movements of the train caused a progressive and surprising reintegration of the nucleus pulposus within the intervertebral disc. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-7.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 7</a></p>

                <h2>The Washing Machine</h2>
                <p>In all probability, no one had ever imagined the possibility of using a common <span class="f1">washing machine</span> for sexual purposes.</p>
                <p>This is precisely what happened when a particularly <span class="f2">perceptive individual</span> had the intuition of using the machine's vibration to accentuate the stimulation of the pelvic erogenous zones during intercourse.</p>

                <p>This original idea has always been much appreciated, so much so that it has generated spin cycle fan clubs who still passionately discuss the most effective revolutions per minute.</p>

                <p>As often happens, the development of a new tool or technique allows for its evolution when used by people other than its <span class="f1">inventors</span>.</p>

                <p>This is what happened to the washing machine when it was used alternatively by a woman with low back pain who, at the end of the spin cycle and the vibrating carnal relationship with her husband, put her feet back on the ground.</p>

                <p>The woman happily experienced the simultaneous disappearance of the back pain that had been tormenting her for several weeks. The prolonged vibration for several minutes had <span class="f2">miraculously</span> eliminated the symptom that no previous treatment technique had managed to scratch.</p>

                <p>Overwhelmed with enthusiasm, the first accidental guinea pig of this unexpected experiment quickly composed herself and, to her great surprise, was even able to take out the newly washed laundry without being forced to <span class="f3">bend</span> her knees.</p>
