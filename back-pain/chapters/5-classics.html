                <p>Even if they are not explicitly part of the McKenzie method, some classic positions can offer unexpected benefits to the back pain sufferer.</p>
                <p>It is worth remembering that these positions must be performed with extreme caution, especially in the case of <span class="f1">acute lumbago</span>, and only after having gained sufficient experience with the previous techniques.</p>
                <p>In fact, some of these positions, although apparently simple, can cause a worsening of symptoms if not performed correctly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block block-single-col">
                <h2>Missionary Position</h2>
                <p>This is certainly the position that best lends itself to the different needs of the back pain sufferer. It allows, in fact, an almost total control of the movements, thus avoiding sudden and uncontrolled stresses on the lumbar region. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-20.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 20</a></p>

                <figure class="full">

                </figure>

                <p>The advantages of this position can be summarized as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The partner's weight does not directly affect the back pain sufferer's spine.</li>
                    <li>The low back pain sufferer can control the movements and adjust the intensity of the thrust.</li>
                    <li>The partner can offer support and stability to the low back pain sufferer.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="block block-single-col">
                <h2>The Lotus</h2>
                <p>This position requires a good level of flexibility and experience, both for the low back pain sufferer and for the partner. It is therefore recommended only for those who have already gained sufficient confidence with the previous techniques.</p>
                <p>The main advantage of this position is the almost complete absence of mechanical stress on the lumbar region, thanks to the support offered by the legs of both partners. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-21.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 21</a></p>

                <figure class="full">
                    <img src="/back-pain/assets/fig-21.jpg" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-21.jpg')" />
                    <figcaption class="floatright">Fig. 21</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>However, it is necessary to pay attention to the initial phase of the position, which requires a certain flexibility of the hips and knees. If you suffer from <span class="f1">acute lumbago</span>, it is better to avoid this position.</p>

                <p>The type of advantage of this position depends on which of the two partners suffers from back pain.</p>

                <p>In the case of low back pain in the male subject, the benefit is determined by the <span class="f1">antalgic compression</span> that the partner's clamped legs exert on the painful area, especially if the symptom is localized in the <span class="f3">sacral area</span>.</p>

                <p>If the female partner, on the other hand, is the one suffering from pain, the benefit is determined by the extension of the lumbar area, as described in the previous chapter on techniques and the McKenzie method.</p>

                <p>The practice of this variation is recommended when the symptomatology has almost completely resolved, to exploit the resulting postural instability. This peculiar aspect will have the great advantage of allowing a fine <span class="f2">proprioceptive</span> strengthening exercise of the lumbar musculature. <a href="#figure22" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-22.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 22</a></p>
