            <h2>Gluteal Contraction</h2>
                <p>A recommendation common to all proposed cases is to try to limit the spasmodic contraction of the glutes, which is often <span class="f3">a prelude to orgasm</span>.</p>
                <p>The strong traction that these muscles exert on the pelvis subjects the iliac wings to an external rotation movement that stresses the sacroiliac joints and can aggravate the <span class="f2">symptoms</span>.</p>
                <p>So, calm down! Greater <span class="f3">self-control</span> highlights a gratifying image of virile superiority and, with an acceptable margin, ensures that you can get dressed without the help of your partner.</p>
                
                <h2>Sado-Masochism</h2>
                <figure class="half floatright">
                    <img src="/back-pain/assets/fig-25.jpg" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-25.jpg')">
                    <figcaption class="floatright">Fig. 25</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>If your partner loves to <span class="f1">tie you</span> to the bed, you can allow it, but please ask them to tighten the knots only after you are well stretched out. Static traction, even if not with the same results as intermittent traction, could at least partially overcome painful contracture and bring relief to suffering muscles.</p>
                <p>Finally, if in a <span class="f2">sado-masochistic surge</span> your partner were to start torturing you with lit cigarettes or pins, convince them at least to use the pain-relieving points of <span class="f1">acupuncture</span> or <span class="f3">Shiatsu</span>. <a href="#figure25" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-25.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 25</a></p>

                
                <h2>The Lumbar Support</h2>
                <p>The lumbar support, also called a medical corset or girdle, is a useful tool for protecting the lumbar region from excessive mechanical stress. It is often used by those who suffer from chronic low back pain or by those who perform activities that involve lifting weights. </p>
                <p>In certain situations, such as intimate relations, this object can pose an embarrassing obstacle. However, if you suffer from <span class="f3">chronic low back pain</span>, it may be that you simply cannot do without it. What to do then, if you want to spend a stimulating evening without enduring either lumbar pain nor the humiliation of your partner's laughter at the embarrasing sight of your back brace?</p>
                <p>The solution is to dye the support black-- replacing the depressing <span class="f2">flesh color</span> in which it's typically supplied-- and attach some studs to it to make it look like an <span class="f1">original bustier</span>.</p>
                <p>Naturally, this stratagem is more difficult to implement if the male in the couple is the low back pain sufferer, but who knows?-- it might also open up never-before-experienced scenarios...</p>
                <p>If you discover that your partner also hides a particularly transgressive nature, try sewing a pair of <span class="f3">garters</span> on the bottom edge... and let me know how things turn out! <a href="#figure26" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-26.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 26</a></p>
