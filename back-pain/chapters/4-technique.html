                <p>When deciding on a position to engage in the exchange of bodily fluids, anyone suffering from back pain must consider the following factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The severity of the pain.</li>
                    <li>Their personal level of experience.</li>
                    <li>The physical abilities of their partner.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A clear distinction must be made between situations of <span class="f1">acute lumbago</span> and <span class="f2">recurrent lumbago</span>.</p>
                <p>The former, due to the intensity of the pain, do not allow for wide ranges of motion, while the latter, given the lower level of pain, allow for positions with greater range and complexity of movement.</p>
                <p>The treatment method best suited to dealing with the complexities of <span class="f3">back pain</span> is certainly the <span class="f1">McKenzie Method</span>.</p>
                <p>This method, based on the self-treatment of pain through extension movements, can prove an indispensable ally in these situations for the person suffering from lower back pain.</p>
                <p>As mentioned, the method proposes the execution of movements that allow a "repositioning" of the damaged anatomical structure, potentially resolving the painful situation. This therapeutic action can also be implemented in a sexual context, with similar results. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-15.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 15</a></p>

            <div class="block block-single-col">
                <p>In the case of <span class="f1">acute lumbago</span>, only positions that allow for movements with a <span class="f2">limited range</span> are recommended.</p>
                <p>The best position is certainly <span class="f3">"doggy style"</span>, which allows the low back pain sufferer to avoid excessive mechanical stress on the painful structures. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-16.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 16</a></p>

                </figure>
                <p>Alternatively, the <span class="f1">"spoon"</span> position can also be used, which also necessitates only a limited range of movement. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-17.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 17</a></p>

                <figure class="full">

                </figure>

                <p>The <span class="f2">"cowgirl"</span> position is also suitable for those suffering from acute lumbago, as it allows the low back pain sufferer to control the movements without subjecting the lumbar region to excessive stress. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-18.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 18</a></p>

                <figure class="full">

                <p>If you suffer from <span class="f3">recurrent back pain</span>, you can use positions with a wider range of movement. In this case, the goal is to progressively increase the stability of the lumbar region through controlled movements.</p>

                <p>This method works by training the muscles that surround the vertebral column, whose primary task is to <span class="f1">maintain the alignment of the vertebrae</span>.</p>

                <p>This stabilization function is increased by finding the best vertebral alignment position and challenging it with controlled actions of small motor stress. The progressive ability of the stabilizing muscles hinders the small and temporary dislocation of the vertebrae that can generate pain.</p>

                <p>As can be inferred from the description of the previous techniques, the one limitation of this treatment is to in any case refrain from excessively large movements once the most suitable position has been found.</p>

                <p>To progressively increase the difficulty of maintaining correct vertebral alignment, those skilled in this technique are allowed <span class="f3">reckless evolutions</span> that will train the stability of the lumbar spine as well as stimulate an ever-increasing level of <span class="f2">fantasy</span>. <a href="#figure19" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-19.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 19</a></p>
