                <p>In addition to the classic methods of contraception for both sexes, some small but fundamental precautions should be added, without which the back pain sufferer would invariably face a worsening of symptoms.</p>
                <p>The <span class="f2">"withdrawal"</span> method is certainly the least recommended, as the sudden flexion of the trunk, necessary for this practice, would compromise the precarious stability of the lumbar region. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-8.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 8</a></p>

            <div class="block block-single-col">
                <h2>The Diaphragm</h2>
                <p>The application of a diaphragm is also not recommended, as it would require an excessively prolonged flexion of the trunk, a movement that anyone suffering from back pain must absolutely avoid. In general, this operation is better suited to flexible individuals, while for the unfortunate person suffering from <span class="f1">acute lumbago</span>, it would be an insurmountable obstacle. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-9.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 9</a></p>

            <div class="block block-single-col">
                <h2>The Pill</h2>
                <p>Although of course the contraceptive pill does not directly involve mechanical stress on the spine, it can indirectly aggravate it due to the water retention the pill can induce. Water retention can cause an accumulation of liquids in the intervertebral discs, which would in turn further increase the mechanical stress to which the affected structures are subjected. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-10.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 10</a></p>
                <p>Worse still, the accumulation of liquids tends to also increase the pressure exerted on the pain receptors, causing an immediate worsening of symptoms.</p>

            <div class="block block-single-col">
                <h2>The Condom</h2>
                <p>The difficulty of unrolling the condom directly on the penis is well-known, especially at the most crucial moment of intercourse.</p>
                <p>A sudden, uncoordinated, and desperate movement could give the final <span class="f2">coup de gr√¢ce</span> to the fragile balance of the lumbar region and cause the definitive collapse of the entire structure.</p>
                <p>Therefore, it is essential that this operation is carried out with <span class="f1">slow and controlled movements</span>, a condition that clashes with the urgency and desire of the moment. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-11.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 11</a></p>
                <figure class="full">
                    <img src="/back-pain/assets/fig-11.jpg" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-11.jpg')">
                    <figcaption class="floatright">Fig. 11</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The choice of condoms with a <span class="f3">"stimulating effect"</span> is also to be discouraged at these times. These condoms-- due to the presence of ribs, dots, or other "stimulating" elements-- cause additional friction and therefore <span class="f2">excessive movement</span>, not recommended for those suffering from back pain. <a onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-12.jpg')" class="citation">Fig. 12</a></p>
                <figure class="half floatleft">
                    <img src="/back-pain/assets/fig-12.jpg" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-12.jpg')">
                    <figcaption class="floatleft">Fig. 12</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <figure class="half floatright">
                    <img src="/back-pain/assets/fig-13.jpg" onclick="openModal('/back-pain/assets/fig-13.jpg')">
                    <figcaption class="floatright">Fig. 13</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The use of <span class="f3">"delaying"</span> varieties of condom is also not advisable in these circumstances. On the other hand, clinical experience in the field has shown that pain, by its nature, is an <span class="f1">exceptional inhibitor</span> and that, in acute phases, the effort to bring and keep the <span class="f2">phallic axis</span> even a few degrees above horizontal makes the use of any device to prolong its <span class="f1">service life</span> counterproductive.</p>
                <p>By contrast, for encounters in total darkness, <span class="f3">"phosphorescent condoms"</span> are absolutely essential. Otherwise, in case of acute lumbago, a series of repeated unsuccessful attempts to hit the target could cause further worsening of symptoms.</p>
